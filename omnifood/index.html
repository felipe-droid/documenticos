<h1> MARK MANSON </h1>
<p> THE DARK SIDE OF THE DIGITAL NOMAD</p>

</div>

<div class="box-2">
<p> The following is the original piece i wrote for CNN last year entrepreneurs, also known 
    as "digital nomads." Since the whole "Work Online, Travel the World and Live the Dream"
    angle had been done to death in a million places. i decided to go the other direction 
    and show the dark side of being a digital nomad- the challenges one faces, the emotional
    pitfalls, the social sacrifices.

</p>

<p>Predictably, CNN hated it, the editors hacked it to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections
    to make it less gloomy. But i was always fond of the original, so i am posting it here unabridged
