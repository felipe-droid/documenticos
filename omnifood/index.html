<h4>
     The following is the original piece i wrote for CNN last year entrepreneurs, also known 
    as "digital nomads." Since the whole "Work Online, Travel the World and Live the Dream"
    angle had been done to death in a million places. i decided to go the other direction 
    and show the dark side of being a digital nomad- the challenges one faces, the emotional
    pitfalls, the social sacrifices.

 <br> <br>Predictably, CNN hated it, the editors hacked it to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections
    to make it less gloomy. But i was always fond of the original, so i am posting it here unabridged.

     &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Not one family amongst that. Being nomadic is easier when you only have 1 person to worry about.

    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not saying it is not doable, same good friends of my mine manage it but would have been a better article with a 50/50.
